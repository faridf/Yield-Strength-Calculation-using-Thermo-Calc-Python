# Yield-Strength-Calculation-using-Thermo-Calc-Python
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to calculate the yield strength of a specified alloy composition using the Thermo-Calc Python (tc_python) API. It sets up the thermodynamic system, selects the property model, configures the required parameters, and prints out the available results.
